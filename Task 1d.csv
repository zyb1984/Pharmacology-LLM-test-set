Combining benzphetamine with antihypertensive drugs can decrease their effectiveness and lead to elevated blood pressure. Close monitoring of blood pressure is advised, and dosage adjustments may be necessary if these medications are used together.
(5) Medications that Affect Urinary pH: Benzphetamine is excreted in urine, and urinary pH can influence its elimination. Concurrent use of medications that alter urinary pH, such as alkalinizing agents or acidifying agents, can affect the clearance of benzphetamine. It is important to inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are taking to assess any potential interactions.","(1) Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): Concurrent use of benzphetamine with MAOIs or within two weeks of MAOI therapy is contraindicated. The combination can lead to severe and potentially life-threatening reactions, such as hypertensive crisis, hyperpyrexia (extremely high body temperature), and central nervous system excitation. It is crucial to allow a sufficient washout period between the use of benzphetamine and MAOIs.
(2) Serotonergic Medications: Benzphetamine may have serotonergic properties. Concurrent use with other medications that increase serotonin levels, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or serotonin modulators, can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by agitation, hallucinations, rapid heartbeat, high body temperature, and changes in blood pressure. Close monitoring is advised if these medications are used together.
(3) Sympathomimetic Agents: Benzphetamine has sympathomimetic properties and can increase blood pressure and heart rate. Concurrent use of other sympathomimetic medications, such as decongestants (e.g., pseudoephedrine) or stimulants (e.g., amphetamines), can potentially lead to additive effects on blood pressure and heart rate. Monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is important when using these medications concurrently.

(14) Dezocine may effect the metabolism rate of some durgs, including Clopidogrel and Ticagrelor, may decrease the metabolism rate  of those drugs when combined with Dezocine.","(1) Central Nervous System Depressants: Dezocine has central nervous system depressant effects. Concurrent use of dezocine with other medications that have sedative or hypnotic effects, such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, sedatives, or alcohol, can enhance the sedative effects and increase the risk of central nervous system depression, including respiratory depression and sedation. Caution is advised when using these medications concurrently, and dosage adjustments may be necessary.
(2) Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): Concurrent use of dezocine with MAOIs or within two weeks of MAOI therapy is contraindicated. The combination can lead to severe and potentially life-threatening reactions, such as serotonin syndrome, hypertensive crisis, or central nervous system toxicity. It is crucial to allow a sufficient washout period between the use of dezocine and MAOIs.
(3) Serotonergic Medications: Dezocine has partial agonist activity at the mu-opioid receptor and weak antagonist activity at the serotonin receptor. Concurrent use with other medications that increase serotonin levels, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or serotonin modulators, can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by agitation, hallucinations, rapid heartbeat, high body temperature, and changes in blood pressure. Close monitoring is advised if these medications are used together.
(4) Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioids: Dezocine is a mixed opioid agonist/antagonist, which means it has both agonist and antagonist effects at different opioid receptors. Concurrent use of dezocine with other opioids, especially pure mu-opioid agonists, can diminish the analgesic effects of dezocine or even precipitate withdrawal symptoms in opioid-dependent individuals. Careful consideration and appropriate dose adjustments are necessary when using these medications together.
(5) CNS Stimulants: Concurrent use of dezocine with CNS stimulants, such as amphetamines or caffeine, may diminish the sedative effects of dezocine.
