1,Ropivacaine,DB00296,medium molecules,"Imagine you are a pharmacologist, answer with fairness, justice, and a scientific attitude.",Ropivacaine is indicated in adult patients for the induction of regional or local anesthesia for surgery or acute pain management.[L42140],"In contrast to most other local anesthetics, the presence of [epinephrine] does not affect the time of onset, duration of action, or the systemic absorption of ropivacaine.[L42140]","Local anesthetics like ropivacaine block the generation and conduction of nerve impulses, presumably by increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve, by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse, and by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential. Specifically, they block the sodium channel and decrease chances of depolarization and consequent action potentials. In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination, and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers.","High systemic doses of ropivacaine can result in central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular effects, with the CNS effects usually occurring at lower blood plasma concentrations and additional cardiovascular effects occurring at higher concentrations (although cardiovascular collapse may occur at lower concentrations). CNS effects include CNS excitation involving nervousness, tingling around the mouth, tinnitus, tremor, dizziness, blurred vision, and seizures. CNS depressant effects may follow, associated with drowsiness, loss of consciousness, respiratory depression and apnea. Cardiovascular events may be caused by hypoxemia secondary to respiratory depression and include hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, and/or cardiac arrest.[L42140,L42265]"
2,Chlorzoxazone,DB00356,small molecules,"Imagine you are a pharmacologist, answer with fairness, justice, and a scientific attitude.",For the relief of discomfort associated with acute painful musculoskeletal conditions.,Chlorzoxazone is a centrally-acting agent for painful musculoskeletal conditions. Data available from animal experiments as well as human study indicate that chlorzoxazone acts primarily at the level of the spinal cord and subcortical areas of the brain where it inhibits multisynaptic reflex a.c. involved in producing and maintaining skeletal muscle spasm of varied etiology. The clinical result is a reduction of the skeletal muscle spasm with relief of pain and increased mobility of the involved muscles.,"Chlorzoxazone inhibits degranulation of mast cells, subsequently preventing the release of histamine and slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), mediators of type I allergic reactions. Chlorzoxazone also may reduce the release of inflammatory leukotrienes. Chlorzoxazone may act by inhibiting calcium and potassium influx which would lead to neuronal inhibition and muscle relaxation. Data available from animal experiments as well as human study indicate that chlorzoxazone acts primarily at the level of the spinal cord and subcortical areas of the brain where it inhibits multisynaptic reflex arcs involved in producing and maintaining skeletal muscle spasm","Oral, mouse: LD50 = 440 mg/kg; Oral, rat: LD50 = 763 mg/kg; Symptoms of overdose include diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, light-headedness, nausea, and vomiting."
3,Montelukast,DB00471,large molecules,"Imagine you are a pharmacologist, answer with fairness, justice, and a scientific attitude.","Montelukast is indicated for:(a) the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in adults and pediatric patients who are 12 months of age and older[L6301], although other regional health authorities specifically note this indication for adults and adolescents who are 15 years and older[L6304,L6307] and also include indications for preventing day and night-time symptoms, and the treatment of acetylsalicylic acid-sensitive asthma[L6304];(b) the prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in patients who are 6 years of age and older[L6301], although other regional health authorities specifically note this indication for adults and adolescents who are 15 years and older[L6304,L6307]; and(c) the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 2 years of age and older and perennial allergic rhinitis in patients 6 months of age and older[L6301], although other regional health authorities specifically note the relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms for adults and adolescents who are 15 years and older[L6304,L6307].Furthermore, some formulations like chewable montelukast tablets may also be specifically indicated by particular regulatory bodies for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma, including the prevention of day and night-time symptoms, the treatment of acetylsalicylic acid based asthma, and the prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 and older[L6328], between the ages 2 and 5[L6325], or between the ages of 6 and 14 years.[L6331]Moreover, when employed for such indications montelukast is considered effective as monotherapy or when combined with other medications indicated for the maintenance treatment of chronic asthma.[L6304,L6328] For instance, montelukast and inhaled corticosteroids can be used concomitantly to demonstrate additive effects to control asthma or to decrease the necessary inhaled corticosteroid dose while still maintaining clinical stability.[L6304,L6328]Additionally, in patients who continue to experience asthma symptoms, montelukast can also be combined with an 'as required' short-acting beta-agonist, an inhaled corticosteroid, or inhaled corticosteroid paired with a long-acting beta-agonist.[L6304,L6328]","Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that demonstrates a marked affinity and selectivity to the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor type-1 in preference to many other crucial airway receptors like the prostanoid, cholinergic, or beta-adrenergic receptors.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] As a consequence, the agent can elicit substantial blockage of LTD4 leukotriene-mediated bronchoconstriction with doses as low as 5 mg.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Moreover, a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n=12) demonstrated that montelukast is capable of inhibiting early and late phase bronchoconstriction caused by antigen challenge by 75% and 57% respectively.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]In particular, it has been documented that montelukast can cause bronchodilation as soon as within 2 hours of oral administration.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] This action can also be additive to the bronchodilation caused by the concomitant use of a beta agonist.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Nevertheless, clinical investigations performed with adults 15 years of age and older revealed that no additional clinical benefit is obtained when doses of montelukast greater than 10 mg a day are used.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]Additionally, in clinical trials with adults and pediatric asthmatic patients aged 6 to 14 years, it was also determined that montelukast can reduce mean peripheral blood eosinophils by about 13% to 15% from baseline in comparison to placebo during double-blind treatment periods.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] At the same time, in patients aged 15 years and older who were experiencing seasonal allergic rhinitis, the use of montelukast caused a median reduction of 13% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts when compared to placebo as well.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]","Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLT) like LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, among others, are eicosanoids released by a variety of cells like mast cells and eosinophils.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] When such CysLT bind to corresponding CysLT receptors like CysLT type-1 receptors located on respiratory airway smooth muscle cells, airway macrophages, and on various pro-inflammatory cells like eosinophils and some specific myeloid stem cells activities that facilitate the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis are stimulated.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]In particular, CysLT-mediated airway bronchoconstriction, occluding mucous secretion, vascular permeability, and eosinophil recruitment are all types of effects that facilitate asthma.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Alternatively, in allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released by the nasal mucosa when exposed to allergens during both early and late phase reactions and participate in eliciting symptoms of allergic rhinitis like a congested nose and airway.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Subsequently, montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT type 1 receptor, which consequently assists in inhibiting any physiological actions of CysLTs like LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 at the receptor that may facilitate asthma or allergic rhinitis.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]","The adverse effects associated with overdosage of montelukast include abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting, psychomotor hyperactivity, and less frequently, convulsion.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]

The oral LD50 value determined for mice and rats is >5000 mg/kg.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]

Montelukast has not been studied in pregnant women.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Consequently, it should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]

Additionally, as it is unknown whether montelukast is excreted into human breast milk, there is also caution regarding the use of the medication in nursing mothers.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]

The plasma half-life of montelukast is somewhat prolonged in elderly patients, although no dosage adjustment is generally necessary.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]"
4,Pefloxacin,DB00487,medium molecules,"Imagine you are a pharmacologist, answer with fairness, justice, and a scientific attitude.",For the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in males and for gram-negative-bacterial infections in the gastrointestinal system and the genitourinary tract.,"Pefloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Flouroquinolones such as pefloxacin possess excellent activity against gram-negative aerobic bacteria such as E.coli and Neisseria gonorrhoea as well as gram-positive bacteria including S. pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. They also posses effective activity against shigella, salmonella, campylobacter, gonococcal organisms, and multi drug resistant pseudomonas and enterobacter.","The bactericidal action of pefloxacin results from interference with the activity of the bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are needed for the transcription and replication of bacterial DNA. DNA gyrase appears to be the primary quinolone target for gram-negative bacteria. Topoisomerase IV appears to be the preferential target in gram-positive organisms. Interference with these two topoisomerases results in strand breakage of the bacterial chromosome, supercoiling, and resealing. As a result DNA replication and transcription is inhibited.","Adverse reactions include peripheral neuropathy, nervousness, agitation, anxiety, and phototoxic events (rash, itching, burning) due to sunlight exposure."
5,Naltrexone,DB00704,medium molecules,"Imagine you are a pharmacologist, answer with fairness, justice, and a scientific attitude.",Used as an adjunct to a medically supervised behaviour modification program in the maintenance of opiate cessation in individuals who were formerly physically dependent on opiates and who have successfully undergone detoxification. Also used for the management of alcohol dependence in conjunction with a behavioural modification program.,"Naltrexone, a pure opioid antagonist, is a synthetic congener of oxymorphone with no opioid agonist properties. Naltrexone is indicated in the treatment of alcohol dependence and for the blockade of the effects of exogenously administered opioids. It markedly attenuates or completely blocks, reversibly, the subjective effects of intravenously administered opioids. When co-administered with morphine, on a chronic basis, naltrexone blocks the physical dependence to morphine, heroin and other opioids. In subjects physically dependent on opioids, naltrexone will precipitate withdrawal symptomatology.","Naltrexone is a pure opiate antagonist and has little or no agonist activity. The mechanism of action of naltrexone in alcoholism is not understood; however, involvement of the endogenous opioid system is suggested by preclinical data. Naltrexone is thought to act as a competitive antagonist at mc, κ, and δ receptors in the CNS, with the highest affintiy for the μ receptor. Naltrexone competitively binds to such receptors and may block the effects of endogenous opioids. This leads to the antagonization of most of the subjective and objective effects of opiates, including respiratory depression, miosis, euphoria, and drug craving. The major metabolite of naltrexone, 6-β-naltrexol, is also an opiate antagonist and may contribute to the antagonistic activity of the drug.","In the mouse, rat and guinea pig, the oral LD50s were 1,100-1,550 mg/kg; 1,450 mg/kg; and 1,490 mg/kg; respectively. High doses of naltrexone (generally >1,000 mg/kg) produce salivation, depression/reduced activity, tremors, and convulsions."
6,Benzphetamine,DB00865,small molecules,"Imagine you are a pharmacologist, answer with fairness, justice, and a scientific attitude.",For the management of exogenous obesity as a short term adjunct (a few weeks) in a regimen of weight reduction based on caloric restriction,"Benzphetamine, a phenylalkylamin, is related to amphetamine both chemically and pharmacologically. It is an anorectic agent indicated in the management of exogenous obesity as a short term adjunct (a few weeks) in a regimen of weight reduction based on caloric restriction. Benzphetamine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, the amphetamines. Actions include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for.","The mechanism of action of these drugs is not fully understood, however it may be similar to that of amphetamines. Amphetamines stimulate noepinephrine and dopamine release in nerve endings in the lateral hypothalamic feeding centre, decreasing appetite. This release is mediated by the binding of benzphetamine to centrally located adrenergic receptors.","LD50=160 mg/kg (orally in rats). Acute overdosage may result in restlessness, tremor, tachypnea, confusion, assaultiveness, and panic states."
7,Irbesartan,DB01029,large molecules,"Imagine you are a pharmacologist, answer with fairness, justice, and a scientific attitude.","Irbesartan is indicated to treat hypertension and diabetic nephropathy in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, elevated serum creatinine, and proteinuria.[L7456] A combination product with hydrochlorothiazide is indicated for hypertension in patients with uncontrolled hypertension with monotherapy or first line in patients not expected to be well controlled with monotherapy.[L7459]","Irbesartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker used to treat hypertension and diabetic nephropathy.[L7456,L7459] It has a long duration of action as it is usually taken once daily and a wide therapeutic index as doses may be as low as 150mg daily but doses of 900mg/day were well tolerated in healthy human subjects.[L7456,L7459,A181165]","Irbesartan prevents angiotensin II binding to the AT1 receptor in tissues like vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland.[L7456,L7459] Irbesartan and its active metabolite bind the AT1 receptor with 8500 times more affinity than they bind to the AT2 receptor.[L7456,L7459] Irbesartan's prevention of angiotensin II binding causes vascular smooth muscle relaxation and prevents the secretion of aldosterone, lowering blood pressure.[L7456,L7459]Angiotensin II would otherwise bind to the AT1 receptor, inducing vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion, raising blood pressure.[L7456,L7459]","The oral TDLO in humans is 30mg/kg/6W.[L7477]Symptoms of overdose include hypotension and tachycardia or bradycardia.[L7456,L7459] Terlipressin may be given to treat hypotension and tachycardia if conventional vasopressors fail to control blood pressure.[A181171]"
8,Dezocine,DB01209,small molecules,"Imagine you are a pharmacologist, answer with fairness, justice, and a scientific attitude.",Indicated in the treatment of moderate to severe pain.,Dezocine is a parenteral narcotic analgesic possessing both agonist and antagonist activity. It is similar to morphine with respect to analgesic potency and onset and duration of action. The narcotic antagonist activity is greater than that of pentazocine.,"Dezocine is a opioid analgesic drug of mixed agonist-antagonist type. It binds with stereospecific receptors at many sites within the central nervous system (CNS) to alter processes affecting both the perception of pain and the emotional response to pain. At least 2 of these types of receptors (mu and kappa) mediate analgesia. Mu receptors are widely distributed throughout the CNS, especially in the limbic system (frontal cortex, temporal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus), thalamus, striatum, hypothalamus, and midbrain as well as laminae I, II, IV, and V of the dorsal horn in the spinal cord. Kappa receptors are localized primarily in the spinal cord and in the cerebral cortex.","Symptoms of overdose include cold and clammy skin, confusion, nervousness, or severe restlessness, convulsions (seizures), severe dizziness, severe drowsiness, low blood pressure, pinpoint pupils of eyes, slow heartbeat, slow or troubled breathing and severe weakness."
9,Amobarbital,DB01351,small molecules,"Imagine you are a pharmacologist, answer with fairness, justice, and a scientific attitude.",Na,,"Amobarbital (like all barbiturates) works by binding to the GABAA receptor at either the alpha or the beta sub unit.  These are binding sites that are distinct from GABA itself and also distinct from the benzodiazepine binding site. Like benzodiazepines, barbiturates potentiate the effect of GABA at this receptor.  This GABAA receptor binding decreases input resistance, depresses burst and tonic firing, especially in ventrobasal and intralaminar neurons, while at the same time increasing burst duration and mean conductance at individual chloride channels; this increases both the amplitude and decay time of inhibitory postsynaptic currents.  In addition to this GABA-ergic effect, barbiturates also block the AMPA receptor, a subtype of glutamate receptor. Glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS.  Amobarbital also appears to bind neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. ",Na
10,Butobarbital,DB01353,small molecules,"Imagine you are a pharmacologist, answer with fairness, justice, and a scientific attitude.",For the treatment of insomnia.,Butethal (also known as butobarbitone and butobarbital) belongs to a group of medicines called the barbiturates. It is thought to act on receptors in the brain (GABA receptors) causing the release of the chemical GABA. This chemical inhibits certain areas of the brain resulting in sleepiness. ,"Butethal binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged. All of these effects are associated with marked decreases in GABA-sensitive neuronal calcium conductance (gCa). The net result of barbiturate action is acute potentiation of inhibitory GABAergic tone. Barbiturates also act through potent (if less well characterized) and direct inhibition of excitatory AMPA-type glutamate receptors, resulting in a profound suppression of glutamatergic neurotransmission.","Signs of overdose include confusion (severe), decrease in or loss of reflexes, drowsiness (severe), fever, irritability (continuing), low body temperature, poor judgment, shortness of breath or slow or troubled breathing, slow heartbeat, slurred speech, staggering, trouble in sleeping, unusual movements of the eyes, weakness (severe)."
11,Dequalinium,DB04209,large molecules,"Imagine you are a pharmacologist, answer with fairness, justice, and a scientific attitude.","Dequalinium is used in several OTC products to treat mouth infections and inflammation, such as tonsillitis, pharyngitis, and gingivitis.[A249255] As vaginal tablets, dequalinium is indicated for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis in adult women under 55 years of age.[L42190]","_In vitro_, dequalinium possesses antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, and protozoa.[A19293] Dequalinium has a rapid bactericidal and fungicidal action.[A19280] The antiparasitic and antiviral properties of dequalinium have also been noted. For example, dequalinium can bind to the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the spike envelope of the human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1.[A249255]

As with other quaternary ammonium compounds similar to dequalinium, gram-positive bacteria are more sensitive to dequalinium than gram-negative bacteria.[A19293,L42190] The bactericidal and fungicidal effects of dequalinium can occur within 30 to 60 minutes.[A19294] According to _in vitro_ studies, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for dequalinium against relevant vaginal pathogens ranges from 0.2 to 鈮?1024 碌g/mL.[L42190]

There is evidence that dequalinium exhibits anticancer activity in human leukemia cells: dequalinium induces a cytotoxic effect by altering redox balance, downregulating Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signalling pathways, and promoting apoptosis of leukemic cells.[A19290,A19291,A19292] Dequalinium was also shown to block small conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels, called SK channels, which are often expressed in some cancer cells to play a role in cell proliferation and migration.[A249255] One study showed that dequalinium reduced macrophage motility in mice, inhibiting macrophage infiltration of irradiated tumours and attenuating local metastasis.[A19289]

Interestingly, dequalinium was shown to modulate and induce self-oligomerization of alpha-synuclein, a synaptic protein known to cause aggregates in several neurodegenerative disorders. This finding highlights the neuroprotective actions of dequalinium; however, further investigations are warranted as dequalinium is a neurotoxic agent.[A249255]","Dequalinium has multiple modes of action. Dequalinium absorbs into the bacterial cell surface and diffuses through the cell wall, disrupting bacterial cell permeability.[A19293,A249255] It is taken up by the bacteria rapidly.[A249255] Once in the bacteria, dequalinium denatures proteins involved in the respiratory chain and glycolysis of bacteria, interfering with bacterial cell metabolism and ribosomal protein synthesis.[A19280,A19293,A249255] By inhibiting bacterial F1-ATPase, dequalinium inhibits mitochondrial ATP synthesis and blocks glucose metabolism. These molecular actions ultimately deplete bacterial energy sources.[A19280] As dequalinium accumulates in the mitochondria, it is considered a mitochondrial poison.[A19295,A249255]

Dequalinium can also precipitate nucleic acids, as it can intercalate one of its quinoline chromophores between DNA base pairs.[A19280,A249255] Depending on the drug concentration, dequalinium can lyse the bacterial cell by promoting osmotic imbalance.[A19280,A19293]","The LD50 was 18300 ug/kg following intraperitoneal administration and 70 mg/kg following subcutaneous administration in mice.[L42260] There is limited clinical experience of drug overdose with dequalinium. While dequalinium is generally well tolerated and considered as safe at recommended therapeutic doses, dequalinium is a neurotoxic agent and mitochondrial poison. At a high dose in mice, the drug caused damages to the liver and kidneys, and caused renal and hepatic failure.[A249255]"
12,Apremilast,DB05676,large molecules,"Imagine you are a pharmacologist, answer with fairness, justice, and a scientific attitude.","Apremilast is indicated for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis and adults with oral ulcers associated with Behcet's Disease. In addition, apremilast is indicated for the treatment of plaque psoriasis, of any severity, in adult patients who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.[L7501]","Apremilast reduces but does not completely inhibit various inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 MCP-1, MIP-1, MMP-3, and TNF-α, relieving the symptoms of psoriasis and Behcet's disease, which are caused by an increase in these inflammatory mediators.[A181220,L7498] This drug has also been proven to be effective in relieving the pain associated with oral ulcers in Behcet's disease.[A181244] Apremilast may cause unwanted weight loss and worsen depression, leading to suicidal thoughts or actions. It is advisable to monitor for symptoms of depression and seek medical attention if they occur, especially in patients with pre-existing depression. The need for apremilast should be carefully assessed along with the risk of worsening depression and suicide. If weight loss occurs, the degree of weight loss should be evaluated, and consideration should be made for the possible discontinuation of apremilast.[L7501]","The full mechanism of action of this drug is not fully established, however, it is known that apremilast is an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), which mediates the activity of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a second messenger.[A181217] The inhibition of PDE4 by apremilast leads to increased intracellular cAMP levels.[L7501] An increase in cAMP results in the suppression of inflammation by decreasing the expression of TNF-伪, IL-17, IL-23, and other inflammatory mediators. The above inflammatory mediators have been implicated in various psoriatic conditions as well as Behcet's disease, leading to their undesirable inflammatory symptoms such as mouth ulcers, skin lesions, and arthritis.[A181220,L7498,L7501] Apremilast administration leads to a cascade which eventually decreases the levels of the above mediators, relieving inflammatory symptoms.","The oral LD50 in mice was greater than 2000 mg/kg in mice.  In rats, oral LD50 was 2000 mg/kg males and 300 mg/kg in females.[L7505]Overdose informationIn healthy subjects receiving a maximum dose of 100 mg (given as 50 mg twice daily) for about 5 days, no significant toxicity was observed. In cases of an overdose, supportive and symptomatic treatment should be administered. Contact the local poison control center for the most recent overdose management for apremilast.[L7502]"
13,Silodosin,DB06207,large molecules,"Imagine you are a pharmacologist, answer with fairness, justice, and a scientific attitude.",Silodosin is indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It is not indicated for the treatment of hypertension.[L32368],"Silodosin is an antagonist of sub-adrenoceptors. It has the highest selectivity for the sub-adrenoceptor subtype, with a 162-fold greater affinity than sub-adrenoceptor and about a 50-fold greater affinity than for sub-adrenoceptor. In clinical trials, silodosin improved maximum urinary flow rate, voiding symptoms, and storage symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia.[A231159, A231174] Following oral administration, silodosin had a rapid onset of effect in men,[A231174] with early effects of relieving lower urinary tract symptoms occurring within two to six hours post-dose.[A231229]Silodosin inhibited the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) tail current; however, it has weak cardiovascular effects.[A231199] As with all sub-adrenoceptor antagonists blocking sub-adrenoceptors in the iris dilator muscle, silodosin may cause intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS), which is characterized by small pupils and iris billowing during cataract surgery in patients taking 伪1-AR antagonists.[A231229]","
The pathogenesis of benign prostatic hyperplasia is not fully understood: it is believed to involve several pathways, including inflammation, apoptosis, and cellular proliferation. Most drug therapies aim to alleviate symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, silodosin included. Lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia are categorized into three main groups: voiding or obstructive (hesitancy, slow stream, intermittency, incomplete emptying), storage or irritative (frequency, urgency, nocturia, urge urinary incontinence), and postmicturition (postvoid dribbling). Prostate contraction is the main contributor to lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The smooth muscle tone of the prostate is regulated by α1A-adrenoceptors, which are the most highly expressed subtype of α1adrenoceptors in the human prostate tissue.[A231159] It has been reported that blockade of α1A-adrenoceptors relieves bladder outlet obstruction. Blockade of α1D-adrenoceptors, another subtype found in prostate tissue, is believed to alleviate storage symptoms due to detrusor overactivity.[A231229]α1-adrenoceptors are G protein-coupled receptors: upon binding of its natural ligand, norepinephrine and epinephrine, leads to the activation of phospholipase C and downstream signalling molecules, including inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol. Ultimately, there is an increase in intracellular calcium levels and, consequently, smooth muscle contraction. Silodosin is an antagonist of α1-adrenoceptors, with the highest selectivity for the α1A-adrenoceptor subtype. By blocking the α1A-adrenoceptor signalling pathway, silodosin promotes prostatic and urethral smooth muscle relaxation, thereby improving lower urinary tract symptoms such as voiding. Silodosin also targets afferent nerves in the bladder, relieving bladder overactivity and storage symptoms..[A231159]","Oral LD50 is 800 mg/kg in rats.[L32393]In clinical trials, postural hypotension was the most common dose-limiting adverse event. In case of drug overdose leading to hypotension, the patient should be placed in a supine position to restore blood pressure and normalize heart rate. Further measures, such as administration of intravenous fluids, may be initiated. In case of the use of vasopressors, renal function should be monitored and supported as needed. Since silodosin is highly bound to plasma proteins, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial.[L32368]"
